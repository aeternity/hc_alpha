// # Compile & Deploy a Sophia Smart Contract
//
// ## Introduction
// The whole script is [located in the repository](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-js/blob/master/examples/node/contract.js) and this page explains in detail how to:
//
// - deal with the different phases of compiling Sophia contracts to bytecode
// - deploy the bytecode to get a callable contract address
// - invoke the deployed contract on the Ã¦ternity blockchain

// ## 1. Specify imports
//
// You need to import `Universal`, `Node` and `MemoryAccount` [Stamps](https://stampit.js.org/essentials/what-is-a-stamp) from the SDK.
const { Universal, Node, MemoryAccount } = require('@aeternity/aepp-sdk')

// **Note**:
//
//  - You need to have the SDK installed via `npm i @aetenity/aepp-sdk -g` to run that example code.

// ## 2. Define constants
// The following constants are used in the subsequent code snippets.
const CONTRACT_SOURCE = // typically you read the source code from a separate .aes file
`
contract Multiplier =
  record state = { factor: int }
  entrypoint init(f : int) : state = { factor = f }
  stateful entrypoint setFactor(f : int): int =
    put(state{ factor = f })
    f * 10
  entrypoint multiplyBy(x : int) = x * state.factor
`
const ACCOUNT_KEYPAIR = {
  publicKey: 'ak_2dATVcZ9KJU5a8hdsVtTv21pYiGWiPbmVcU1Pz72FFqpk9pSRR',
  secretKey: 'bf66e1c256931870908a649572ed0257876bb84e3cdf71efb12f56c7335fad54d5cf08400e988222f26eb4b02c8f89077457467211a6e6d955edb70749c6a33b'
}
const NODE_URL = 'https://testnet.aeternity.io'
const COMPILER_URL = 'https://compiler.aepps.com';

// Note:
//
//  - The keypair of the account is pre-funded and only used for demonstration purpose
//      - You should replace it with your own keypair (see
//        [Create a Keypair](../../quick-start.md#2-create-a-keypair))
//  - In case the account runs out of funds you can always request AE using the [Faucet](https://faucet.aepps.com/)

// ## 3. Open async codeblock
// Most functions of the SDK return _Promises_, so the recommended way of
// dealing with subsequent actions is running them one by one using `await`.
// Therefore you need to put the logic into an `async` code block
(async () => {
  // ## 4. Create object instances
  const account = MemoryAccount({ keypair: ACCOUNT_KEYPAIR })
  const node = await Node({ url: NODE_URL })
  const aeSdk = await Universal({
    nodes: [{ name: 'testnet', instance: node }],
    compilerUrl: COMPILER_URL,
    accounts: [account]
  })

  // The `Universal` [Stamp](https://stampit.js.org/essentials/what-is-a-stamp) itself is
  // asynchronous as it determines the node's version and rest interface automatically. Only once
  // the Promise is fulfilled, you know you have a working object instance
  // which is assigned to the `aeSdk` constant in this case.
  //
  // Note:
  //
  //   - `Universal` is not a constructor but a factory, which means it's *not* invoked with `new`.

  // ## 5. Get contract instance
  // Knowing the source code allows you to initialize a contract instance and interact with the
  // contract in a convenient way.
  console.log(CONTRACT_SOURCE)
  const contract = await aeSdk.getContractInstance({ source: CONTRACT_SOURCE })

  // ## 6. Compile the contract
  // The `compile` function sends a raw Sophia contract as string
  // to the HTTP compiler for bytecode compilation. In the future this will be done
  // without talking to the node, but requiring a bytecode compiler
  // implementation directly in the SDK.
  const bytecode = await contract.compile()
  console.log(`Obtained bytecode ${bytecode}`)

  // ## 7. Deploy the contract
  // Invoking `deploy` on the contract instance will result in the `CreateContractTx`
  // being created, signed (using the _secretKey_ of the previously defined `MemoryAccount`) and
  // broadcasted to the network. It will be picked up by the miners and written to the chain.

  const deployInfo = await contract.deploy([5])
  console.log(`Contract deployed at ${deployInfo.address}`)

  // Note:
  //
  //  - Sophia contracts always have an `init` function which needs to be invoked.
  //  - The SDK generates the required `calldata` for the provided arguments by
  //    `@aeternity/aepp-calldata` package.

  // ## 8. Call a contract function
  // Once the `ContractCreateTx` has been successfully mined, you can attempt to invoke
  // any public function (aka `entrypoint` in Sophia) defined within it.

  await contract.methods.setFactor(6)

  // **Note**:
  //
  //  - `setFactor` is a stateful entrypoint that changes to the contract's state so `contract`
  //    broadcasting the transaction to be mined

  // ## 9. Call a contract function via dry-run
  // You can use `callStatic` option which performs a `dry-run` of the
  // transaction which allows you to get the result without having to mine a transaction.

  let call = await contract.methods.setFactor(7, { callStatic: true })

  // ## 10. Decode the call result
  // The execution result, if successful, will be an FATE-encoded result value.
  // The `decodedResult` property will contain the result value decoded using calldata package.

  console.log(`setFactor execution result: ${call.decodedResult}`)

  // ## 11. Call a contract non-stateful entrypoint via dry-run

  call = await contract.methods.multiplyBy(8)
  console.log(`multiplyBy execution result: ${call.decodedResult}`)

  // **Note**:
  //
  //  - The `contract` automatically chooses to perform a dry-run call as `multiplyBy` is a
  //    non-stateful entrypoint
  //  - if `multiplyBy` would be a `stateful entrypoint` the transaction would be broadcasted to
  //    the network and picked up by miners

// ## 12. Close and run async codeblock
// Now you can close the async codeblock and execute it at the same time.
